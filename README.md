# SNP Analyzer
A simple script to extract human genome data from the Entrez database and sorts it for analysis
## Why
I am not a bioinformatian I'm just doing this for fun, this project isn't meant to be used by professionals
## Vocabulary
SNP: Single nucleotide polymorphism: code for position of the gene
Entrez: Database for genes/proteins
List clinical significance
